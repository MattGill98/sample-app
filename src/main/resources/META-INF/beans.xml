        bean-discovery-mode is "annotated" by default since CDI 2.0.
        If the file is created and the version is empty, the default is "all".

        "annotated" means that only classes with bean-defining annotations are scanned (scopes, interceptors and decorators).
        "all" means that all classes are scanned.
        "none" means that no classes are scanned.

        if "none", or no beans.xml and a CDI extension is specified, the archive is not a bean archive
        if beans.xml is empty, or version is 1.1+ and mode is "all", the archive is an explicit archive
        if no beans.xml and CDI 2.0, or mode is "annotated", the archive is an implicit bean archive
